# Virtual Controller for Android and iOS

<b><i> NOTE: 
  
  This is still a work-in-progress app. 
  
  Although it is fully functional at the moment, some minor bugs exist such as errors that sometimes popup when resizing on iOS.
  
  The server also currently works in a .NET coding environment and not as a standalone exectuble program (.exe file).
  
  There are more planned features that include:
  
  1- Full customizability over styling of buttons
  
  2- Resizing and styling customizability of sticks
